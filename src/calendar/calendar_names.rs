/*
In Chinese, **"Gregorian Calendar"** is written as:

**公历** (Gōnglì)

Here’s the breakdown:
- **公** (Gōng) means "public" or "official."
- **历** (Lì) means "calendar."

**公历** is the term most commonly used in mainland China to refer to the Gregorian calendar. Another term you may encounter is **阳历** (Yánglì), which refers to the solar calendar, in contrast to the lunar calendar. However, **公历** is the more common term for the Gregorian calendar.

/*
"Chinese lunar calendar" in Chinese is:

**农历** (Nónglì)

Here’s the breakdown:
- **农** (Nóng) means "agriculture" or "farming," reflecting the historical link between the lunar calendar and agricultural cycles.
- **历** (Lì) means "calendar."

Another term you might encounter is **阴历** (Yīnlì), which literally means "yin calendar" (referring to the moon, as opposed to the solar or yang-based calendar), but **农历** is more commonly used in daily language.
